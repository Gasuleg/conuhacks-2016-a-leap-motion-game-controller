# Conuhacks 2016 - A Leap Motion Game Controller

## Description
Made in Java with Olivier Gr√©goire, designed and developed during the Concordia University's 24h hackaton. The idea was to map keystrokes with right hand postures.
We made our tests with the game Magicka, by replacing each spell by a posture with the right hand. The game became harder and funnier to play, allowing us to epic battles by spelling like a real sorceler with hands.

## Execution
Make sure to have installed at least the JRE 1.8. If you are using Eclipse, simply open and compile, otherwise please follow this guide: https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/java/devguide/Project_Setup.html.
On the GUI, indicate the game program and choose a hand postures number: it will open a second window for configuring the hand postures. Enter the key letter to be pressed, do a posture over the Leap Motion and save the posture by pressing one of the button.
